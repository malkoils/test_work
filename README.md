Hello there , some recrut scripts

it turns out that the automation task was optional, but I just forgot to read to the end and started to initially make an automated script in order 

Additional task. Automation system.

Implement a system that:
1.	will automatically download files from an FTP address
2.	will process the data and get a ready CSV table
3.	will send this table to the specified FTP address

The solution can be executed in any programming language

Your solution to the first and second tasks should be published separately on github and commented on during the interview.
